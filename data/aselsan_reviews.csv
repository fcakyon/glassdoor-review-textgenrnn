","Bureaucracy is overwhelming. Management's culture is somehow inherited from army since it is a army affiliated company, it is no surprise. 

Careerwise as a software engineer, your exposure to the new technologies is limited and depends on the project that you work on. 

It is a good paying comfort zone for most of the people, for most people it becomes a 9 to 5 job, people lose their ambitions etc. After working 3-4 years here, then landing a better paying competitive job becomes impossible, because:

a) Aselsan pays software engineers way above the market average
b) After working 3-4 years in Aselsan, most of the software engineer's skilset might become very outdated, especially if they are not working on the side projects.
