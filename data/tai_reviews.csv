Wed Apr 10 2019,Anonymous,,Former Employee ,Getting bigger and bigger everyday,0,"TAI (with new name Turkish Aerospace) is the oldest and biggest aerospace company in Turkey. They are expending so fast, every week more than 100 person starts in company. There are a lot of different projects and tons of different departments. Some departments and projects work in world class quality due to the customers like Boeing and Airbus, but some other departments cannot reach that level and managed poorly. Huge funds are given by government so their future is 
- Pays well enough considering market average.
- Facility in Ankara has good employee services like fitness, housing, hospital, school, parks, ideal to leave if you do not mind being far away from social activities or city center.
- If hired by a good department there is so much opportunities to learn and develop yourself, perfect for new graduates.
- Funding for most projects especially domestic ones are huge and this will bring world class training and travel opportunities.
- Working in a Boeing, Airbus or similar big projects makes you a ideal candidate for jobs located in foreign countries and ease moving out of country.
- Company encourages further education (masters and doctorate) as long as you prove that this will an asset for company in the future. 
- Health insurance package is over the market average.
","- Company does not have an independent modern management system, it is controlled by government and this will effect upper management assignments, not all managers have required skills.
- There is a clear favoritism for most of non technical positions, sometimes for technical positions as well.
- There is too much circulation, skilled people choose to live company after getting enough experience.
- If you experience problems in your department, most of the time they do not let you to move another department, moving inside company is limited unless you are really needed by more important department.
- There are too much unskilled and under performanced staff, most of them can work in company until retirement unless they do something illegal or highly immoral. This reduces the efficiency and also reduces the motivation of people who shows good performance. 
- There is a huge pressure on employees due to tight deadlines, especially projects related with domestic products which are used by government as a political material during election periods.
- Working hours are 45 hours per a week, not the best in market.

","Company is very insufficient at managerial skills. Most of the managers have no idea about managing a team or a group. Mangers lack basic project management skills and cannot take any action when a problem occurs. Company is privately held but the main share holder is the state so the state and the politics are quite effective on the company. Performance evaluation does not exist and there is no feedback for the employees. The main campus is 60 km away from city center and completely isolated from social life. It usually takes 2 hours on the road to reach the work place. Plus, you have to work 10 hours per day and that makes you have to spend 12 hours per day for the company for a salary that is almost minimum wage in Europe. Work environment is also very unproductive. People spend hours for chatting and walking around, which makes the company very insufficient at the end.
Advice to Management
An efficient, productive and calm work environment should be provided. Work hours per week should not be more than 35 hours. All technical and non-technical managers should be educated in managerial skills, and tested before promoting to managerial positions. MBA or project management masters degree should be required for the managers.
