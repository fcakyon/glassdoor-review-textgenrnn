Wed Jan 06 2021, Financial Analyst,,Current Employee ,"New Tech, Old mentality",0,"*Tries to develop tech in new areas, not just a telco company but a tech company.

*Good benefits, above average pay.

*Fully remote during Covid.

*Great building in Küçükyalı.

*Latest model iPhone/Android and a nice laptop is given every some years.

*It is a great school to learn, responsibility from day one thing is real here.

*Above you will see a big list of cons BUT still, these are mostly the problems of the country in general, Turkcell is still a great place to work (in Turkey standards sadly!)

*Obviously great for career oppurtunities.
","*The mentality is all about money, the upper management mostly care about financials only. Not much attention given to value provided to customers.

*The prices devices are sold in Pasaj is ridiculous, the prices of data packages even more ridiculous. You would only buy these if you are ignorant to price tag or don't know about the current market or e-shopping. (I believe only elderly people prefers to shop from Pasaj, and the whole design is aimed at them, e.g. you can not see discount amount in percentage, ""50 TL discount!"" is merely a illusion for eyes)

*Above mentioned path Turkcell is following affects all the departments. Everyone is trying to save the day and not to appear bad to upper management's eyes. Nobody cares about customer. Nobody cares about other departments. Nobody cares about anything other than his/her annual performance.

*Government wants, Turkcell serves.

*They act like you desperately need to work in Turkcell. It's as if they are offering you their blessings and get nothing in return, hard work doesn't really get recognized.

*Too much corporate feel in business side, tech side might be different. Not really a good fit for 21st century.

*Gender equality and diversity inclusion is in really really bad situation. 

*Tech they release is mostly a copy of sector leaders' apps and they also feel like they appeal only to old people. Too much false hope given to useless apps (personal opinion).

*You can't close your laptop even at night. TOO MUCH OVERTIME (not paid). Work is only thing I can think from 07.30 until I sleep at night. It is very common you get job calls, mails, meetings, demands from managers even after 6 P.M. (They try not to bother you in holidays tho, they are still better than most of Turkish standards sadly...)

","The salary increase is not high. If you work for long years, salary becomes very low. There is no salary adjustment.

Government influence is very high. Government supporters are hired in these days. If you are government supporter, it does not matter if you do your job or not.

The headquarter is not enough for so many people. 

The catering company is very bad. I hardly had my lunch there. It has a close relationship with the government, so nothing happens.

There is no career path. You do not know what will happen in the future.

There is a very chaotic environment. Who does what is very uncertain. Employees focus on how not to do a job. 

Managers are lack of technical abilities. They do not have leadership abilities. They do not what-what their employees are working on.

HR is not available. I did not even see HR while I was leaving my job.

Good employees are escaping from the company.

Not a fair company. If you are a bad employee, the company gives you a reward and you leave your job. But if you are a good employee and leaving the job, it gives nothing. I know some people not working for years to make them fired and get a reward.

Not for innovative and smart developers. You are only a headcount in the database.

They do not give responsibility to employeers but wants to be done perfectly from them.

Fri Mar 24 2017, Expert Product Manager,Istanbul,Former Employee ,"Not a public company anymore, under full control of government",4,"-The office is great, benefits, perks and compensation is not bad.
-Still some great staff left from the times of previous CEO, trying to keep up the mood.
-Company sends the staff to global events to follow the latest technology.
","-Board is under full control of Turkish government starting from 2013, no more a true public company, but state owned.
-All the CXOs have been forced to quit and replaced with ruling party(AKP) supporters. 
-Skilled people left the company and many more in line, as Turkcell has become a governmental instutition with increasingly toxic company culture from top to the bottom.
-Hiring process is completely outsourced to a consultancy firm, Mental HR, which is founded by the relatives of the president Erdogan.
-Hundreds of people laid off without any reason due to political concerns of ruling party AKP in 2016.
-Previous CEO, Sureyya Ciliv was a visionary leader, trying to create the ""Google"" of Turkey, with a great emphasis on innovation and R&D. Current one is merely a business man, who only cares about quarterly results and acting as the agent of government.
Advice to Management
In any case, the government will not get hands off this company, because they are providing sponsorship to pro-government foundations, letting tenders to pro-government 3rd party companies, and filling managerial positions with untalented pro-government people. The pie is too big and too sweet. The corruption already started and downfall is inevitable, already lost a great market share in the last couple of years to Vodafone. Turkcell will become a farm of government, similar to TurkTelekom or Turkish Airlines sooner or later. My advice to the next Turkish government will be getting hands off the board, and let this company be great again.

","Turkcell has the common weakness of telecom companies: slow, politicized, bureaucratic, old fashioned corporate-culture which does not fit into the 21st century technology business. As a result, most of the people don't like what they do here, but still stay as they don't believe they can find a better job, it is mostly frustrating to work with these people. Although the organization structure changes frequently, career opportunities are limited and only the people that the respective managers know very well are promoted.
