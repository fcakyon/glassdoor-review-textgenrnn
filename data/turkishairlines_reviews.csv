If you manage to stick with them for a while, you also get the bonus of free or cheap tickets to anywhere they fly or often where partner airlines fly. Your training will often send you to Turkey for what amounts to a free vacation with some schooling during the day.
","The company as a whole is entirely too stuck on the past. They are truly a Turkish company. There is a general attitude of every man and woman for themselves, and everything, and I do mean EVERYTHING, must go through a chain of command for approval. If I wanted to buy a box of staples I would likely need approval. Their biggest problem is that for a global company they are still so heavily focused in Turkey. The headquarters and most of the support staff and call centers are all located there, and often times they do not speak english, which at this time is the global language. Constant complaints by customers talk about an inability for people within the company or at the call centers, to understand their problems and assist them. There is a distinct lack of understanding of the global marketplace, and it hurts their ability to expand. After seeing things from the inside, it is clear that if the company was not so hooked into the government of Turkey, that it would fail. However that connection, which allows low pricing, also hurts the company. The company is basically controlled to a large degree by the politics in Turkey. They rotate staff, which while it allows for staff to see more of the world, also hurts local offices. If someone has just figured out the local market and is suddenly replaced by someone who does not understand the local market and comes from another part of the world, it hurts that office. This is a constant thing with Turkish Airlines, and if you do not transfer where they want, you are forced out. We have lost many a great employee because they did not go along with the herd. This company seems strong from the outside, but from the inside it seems weak and I still do not understand how they are currently successful with the amount of internal infighting and issues with the companies structure.
Advice to Management
You are a global company. Act like it. You micromanage far too much from Turkey and in reality should have regional headquarters managing local offices in that area, instead of having all these tiny local offices all over the world forced to report to HQ causing all sorts of delays due to the time differences, and issues due to the language, cultural, lifestyle, and monetary adjustments. Do not move major staff around so much. In the travel industry you need to know your market so you can sell to them. Having people constantly rotating around may give people a broader world view, but it hurts local markets. Learn to truly be a global company. Turkey is not the center of the world, and the global language is not Turkish. When customers call, they should be able to deal with people who understand them, and as of right now, English is the global language. Your employee's should speak it, especially if they work in local offices not in Turkey.

Employees have some tickets to travel for ""free"". The aviation academy courses are done by competent and passionate people.
","Management, low, middle, high. All is decided by politics. There are no opportunities to grow if you are not turkish or affiliated to a political party. Management has no respect of local laws and for employees and their families. There is no people management course done for these appointed managers, they treat staff badly and think that staff is there only to ""steal""money from the company. Most of the time managers think only about their personal business by using the local staff as personal assistants. There is no meritocracy. Difference in treatment between local staff and local but turkish staff.
Advice to Management
You should consider calling back all the useless managers you have abroad, they are NOT the face of the company (how can they be when most of them does not speak even english???) Try using the money the company is spending on those and give it so some worthy local manager that can do 100 times better than the turkish manager. Station managers are useless if they are not coming from an operative environment. Start by allowing local staff to grow in the company only by doing this you will have passionate and dedicated staff.

Advice to Management
If TK is really globally yours, use English for any occasion. English is a global language. Turkish is local language. So please, widen your world. The world is so much bigger than just Turkey.

Call back other managers and let alone the country manager. Local staff can do the same, maybe better work than Turkish Managers. Look at other airlines, they only have 1 country managers and let the locals be managers. Its save TK's cost of migrating them in the other hand, it gives opportunity for the local staff.

Build a standard and measurement in hiring people. Not every turkish can work especially as TK is going international. Get rid of those people who is not competent.
